## Laundry No More  
Revolutionizing the way America does laundry by solving our dirtiest of issues: cleaning (and folding) our laundry.

## Project Description
Laundry No More is an app that saves users' time and effort by allowing them to extend the benefits of a shared economy to their laundry. Users can sign up to have their dirty laundy picked up, cleaned, folded, and returned to their house within 24 hours.

## Problem statement
Time is our most precious asset. Other peoblems that we have as a soceity includes trusting strangers. Finally, finding local employment is an issue for local economies.

## How will your project solve this problem?
Laundry No More saves users' time by allowing them have trusted Cleaning Technicians pick up, launder, and deliver their dirty laundry. User reviews inspire trust on both sides of the interface. This app also helps unemplyment by affording the public opportunities to earn extra money by registering as a Cleaning Technician.

## Map the user experience
* Users will download and sign up for the app, verify their identity, and set a "Home" location. Users will save access procedures to their Home location in the app (key code, for example). The access procedure will only be transmitted to verified Cleaning Technicians once the Cleaning Techniican accepts an Open Laundry Order
* Users can request a pickup for their dirty laundry at their home location through the app. Users will set the number of loads, and speficiy special instructions via the app interface
* Cleaning technicians can select an Open Laundry Order through the app's map-based interface and will then have 24 hours to pick up, clean, fold, and deliver the laundry
* Price is pre-set based on the number of loads of laundry, and includes a delivery fee
* Both parties leave a star rating with an optional comment  
* Payment is automatically processed through the app once the user marks the laundry delivered

## What technologies do you plan to use?
* Google Maps API
* Strip Payments API
