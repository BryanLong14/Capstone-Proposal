# Capstone Project Proposal: _Can I Eat That?_   

## Project Description
* _Can I Eat That?_ is a mobile app that allows users to quickly create a custom list of food items and then easily avoid purchasing those items when shopping.
* Users can choose to avoid foods based on dietary restrictions such as paleo, vegan, vegetarian, and autoimmune diet. Alternatively, users can customize a list of foods to avoid based on specific allergies or food sensitivities.
* Users are then able to scan barcodes at the grocery store to see if the product contains any of items on their list.
* Item nutrition information is also displayed so users can track their health goals.    

## What Problem Does Your Project Solve?
With continually emerging science in agriculture and health, people are realizing the extent to which food allergies and food sensitivities affect them. In the United States alone, researchers estimate that up to 15 million Americans have food allergies<sup>1</sup>. Currently, these people do not have access to a tool that can easily tell them if allergens are contained in food.
